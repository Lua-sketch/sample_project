      <h3>What I do</h3>
      <p>When I'm not in school, I have a few ways to keep myself occupied.
        I am a volunteer TA in Robotics For All, currently in a Lego Explorers and a code.org class.
        I take part in a training program for mathematics olympiads in a local university, where I
        was also invited to take Number Theory with their undergrads. I couldn't enroll in other courses
        due to the pandemic.
        I have a coding club for girls and write a column in the school newspaper about women in STEM.
        Every year, I participate in the Breakthrough Junior Challenge with physics video submissions.
        Currently, I'm participating in Qubit by Qubit, a quantum computing course which made me want to code.
        I began coding independently, with HTML/CSS, then Python, Lua, and Processing.
        Now I'm reviewing HTML/CSS and learning JS.
        In my free time, I play the guitar.
        Finally, I'm currently studying wormholes and trying to write a review article on whether transversable
        wormholes are a feasible prospect for a time travel technology.</p>
